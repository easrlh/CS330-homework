### Assignment 3: Data Types and Naming Conventions ###
#### By Eva Lynch ####

This assignment will be a guide to representing different types of data in JavaScript. We will cover naming conventions...

#### JavaScript Naming Coventions ####
Every language has it's own naming conventions, as in the way the language's community has agreed to write and format code written in that language, to improve code readability and ease of code maintenance. A language could have certain ways it prefers class names to be written, which could be different from how variables should be written and method names and so on. These style guidelines could also have rules for white space, indentation, and how to write comments. Some examples of different naming conventions are camel case (varName), using underscores (var_name), whether the first letter can be capitalized or if that's reserved for class names, if numbers and symbols can be used, and many more. 

Some examples of the different naming conventions for JavaScript are: 

Camel case for variables and functions, and they must start with a letter
- int: `var count = 3;` and `var graduationYear = 2021;`
- string: `var firstName = "Eva";`
- floating-point number: `var price = 10.9;` and `var taxRate = 0.20;`
- boolean: `var complete = true;`
- array/list: `var values = ["Corgi", "Husky", "Poodle"];`
- hash/dictionary: `var h = new HashTable();`
