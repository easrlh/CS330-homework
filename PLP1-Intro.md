### Homework 1: Intro to JavaScript

1. What is the name of your language?

JavaScript

2. When/where was it created and by whom? Was it developed to address a particular computing problem or need?

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich for a US company called Netscape. 
The company created one of the first web browsers and they recruited Eich because they wanted him to create a 
programming language for that web browser. [[Source](http://2ality.com/2011/03/javascript-how-it-all-began.html)]

3. Is it primarily procedural, functional, scripted, object-oriented, or a combination of these? Or something else?

JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, 
and functional programming styles. [[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)]

4. Is it compiled or interpreted, or a combination? Does it use a virtual machine?

JS is interpreted. A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run. The source code is passed 
through a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute. 
In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript 
code, interprets each line, and runs it. More modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, 
which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run. [[Source](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs98si/slides/overview.html)]

5. What types of applications is your language primarily used for (e.g.: web development, video games, mobile devices, back-end services, operations engineering, etc.). If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different applications it has been used for.

JavaScript is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well 
(such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat). JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to 
design and program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. [[Source 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)] and [[Source 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript)]

6. Search on Github.com for your language: what are the 3 most popular projects (the ones with the most stars) involving your language?

     - [freeCodeCamp / freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/README.md) with 297k stars: freeCodeCamp is an open-source codebase and curriculum that offers a free and self-paced full stack web development lessons.
     - [vuejs / vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) with 127k stars: Vue.js is a progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web.

7. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? Provide a list of the names of books, website URLs or any other resources (e.g. style guidelines) that relate to your language in particular. 
I will review these before approving your selection.
