### Install JavaScript

#### Questions About Installation

1. Can this language be installed on any operating system? Which ones (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux)? If not, what are its limitations? 

There is no need to install JavaScript. The language is a client-side language that web browsers read, like HTML and CSS which also don’t need to be installed.

2. Give instructions for how to install the language. 

No installation is necessary for JavaScript. That said, JavaScript may need to be enabled in rare cases. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.enable-javascript.com).

3. Where do you write programs in this language (e.g.: in: in a text editor, a special editor just for that language, or something else?) 

I installed the Visual Studio Code editor. VS Code has built in editing support for JavaScript and a number of other languages. VS Code can be installed on both Windows and macOS. To get started coding you’ll need to download Visual Studio Code ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)). 
Be sure to save your files as .js so that VS Code is reading your code as JavaScript or change the language in the bottom right corner of the VS Code application to JavaScript (look for the bell and smiley face icon).

Related Question: Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you'll be using? 

When I was looking into JavaScript, I didn’t see any IDEs mentioned specifically that I can remember, but I asked my developer friends what they used in industry and the majority said VS Code. I googled what the best free IDEs for JavaScript were as well and came up with VS Code again via this [link](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/200/top-7-best-free-web-development-ide-for-javascript-html-and-css).

4. How do you run programs that you write? 

In order for you to run the javascript files you program, you’ll need to download Node.js (available for all operating systems—macOS, Windows, and Linux), a javascript runtime. This is needed because JavaScript was originally something you could only run in the browser, but with a JavaScript runtime, you can run JavaScript on your machine as a standalone application and have the capabilities of other languages like Python. ([Source](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5))

After installing Node.js ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)), restart/start VS Code and then you can use the integrated VS Code terminal to run your files by typing out `node fileName.js`. To view the integrated terminal, navigate to the task bar of your computer (this is the bar at the top of your screen where the battery percentage is displayed for a Mac), click on “Terminal” and select “New Terminal”.

5. Is there a lot of boiler-plate code needed to write a program (e.g. Java)? Or can you just start writing (e.g. Python and Perl)? 

With my experience so far (a hello world program following [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)), it seems that you can just begin writing in javascript, no boiler plate needed.

6. How do you write comments in your language? 

Comments in JavaScript are the same as Java.

`// single line comments`

`/* multi-line comment */`
